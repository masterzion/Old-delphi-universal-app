        TkbmIndex to take advantage of those features too.
        Problem indicated by mariusz@nizinski.net.

        Added support for ftFmtBCD.
        Fixed InternalOpen problem which recreated fields/fielddefs for attached tables.

        and attached table. Bug reported by michael.bonner@ci.fresno.ca.us.
        Added support for ftTimestamp for LEVEL6 compilers (D6/BCB6).

        Removed TkbmTreadDataset from Kylix distribution.
        Added ClearModified method to TkbmMemTable to clear out modification flags
        of both fields and table. Suggested by hans@hoogstraat.ca
        Changed so IsDataModified flag is not set if Edit/Post do not change anything.
        Suggested by hans@hoogstraat.ca

        Improved filtering to check for variant empty/null.
        Added support for BCB6.
        Added support for Kylix1. Please notice that the memtable designer although
        ported for Linux, is not available simply because I cannot find a
        decent way to invoke the default field editor programatically.
        Thus all custom component editors have been disabled for Kylix 1.
        Fixed RecordTag use while filtering bug. Bug reported by Aart Molenaar (almo@xs4all.nl)
        Fixed comparing very large values in CompareField which could raise OutOfRange error.

        Fixed problem comparing longint and int64 fields in comparefields.
        Fixed sorting bugs introduced in 3.00f6.
        Fixed searching using FindKey/FindNearest on descending indexes.
        Fixed CompareBookmark function to better test for invalid bookmarks.
        Fixed Persistent save during destruction which could lead to A/V.

Whats new in v. 3.00f6 Beta
--------------------------------------------
 3.00f6 Fixed massive leak in TkbmBinaryStreamFormat resulting from
        missing to indicate records were part of table.
        Changed so LoadFromDataset only issues First if source table was not on
        first record. Will satisfy forward only sources.

        Added sfSaveInsert flag to TkbmCustomStreamFormat which will save to a
        stream at the current position. Other values are sfSaveAppend which will
        append to the stream and none which will overwrite contents of stream.

--------------------------------------------
Fixes/Enhancements:
 -  Fixed Range comparison on multiple fields.

Whats new in v. 3.00b Alpha (11. Aug. 2001)
--------------------------------------------
Fixes/Enhancements:
 -  Fixed GetRecord(grCurrent) when filter not matching.
 -  Fixed missing Refresh in SwitchToIndex when FRecNo=-1;
 -  Removed DesignActivation from D3 since D3 doesnt have SetActive.
 -  Fixed Lookup field type bug.
 -  Fixed setting IsDataModified when versioning is enabled and record deleted.
 -  Altered CopyRecords to copy autoinc value from source if destination table is empty.
 -  Fixed FindKey/GotoKey returning True on second run even if key not found.
 -  Reordered property entries of TkbmCustomMemTable.

New stuff:

Whats new in v. 3.00a Alpha (22. July. 2001)
--------------------------------------------
Fixes/Enhancements:
 - Moved FieldTypeNames and FieldKindNames to interface section for compability with kbmMW.  
 - Removed wrong setting of FRecalcOnIndex in BuildFieldList.
 - Made BuildFieldList, FindFieldInList, IsFieldListsEqual and SetFieldListOptions public.
 - Fixed A/V bug setting Deltahandler to nil.
 - Added new ADataset parameter to OnCompressBlobStream and OnDecompressBlobStream.

New stuff:
 - Rearranged I/O scheme. Thus SaveToBinaryxxxx, LoadFromBinaryxxxx and
   SaveToxxxx and LoadFromxxxx along with all the CSV save flags are
   not available anymore. Instead two new components TkbmBinaryStreamFormat,
   and TkbmCSVStreamFormat has been introduced. New formats for save and
   load can be build by inheriting from TkbmCustomStreamFormat or
   TkbmStreamFormat.
   (De)Compression of load/save operations has now been moved to the TkbmCustomStreamFormat
   components. Thus code for these events need to be moved.
 - Improved bookmarkvalid check by adding TkbmUserBookmark.

Note:
 This is an alpha release, and although most seems to work fine, it needs more testing.
 Further the TkbmCustomStreamFormat base class _can_ change, although its probably only going to be minor
 changes. But new I/O format classes may need small updates on later kbmMemTable releases.
